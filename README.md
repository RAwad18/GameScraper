# GameScraper
Users can search and compare video game prices on different websites and digital stores.

### Note
Everything is being reworked! I don't know what my pea brain was thinking when I originally considered this project finished. If you're reading this right now...this readme will get rewritten once I'm finished with the code.

### Changes
- SIX websites now (Steam, GameBillet, GamersGate, GamesPlanet (US), WinGameStore, and 2Game)
- Scrape all games on those websites once a day
- Added a database to store the scraped data (originally I was scraping game info after every request...how stupid was that?).
- Added logging for scraping and database transactions

### What's Left?
- Rework the backend...queries will be sent to the database and results will be retrieved using MySQL magic! 🧙‍♂️
- Rework the frontend logic...and maybe make it look prettier. 😶‍🌫️

### Special Note
Hire me.  $150k salary (negotiable) (flexible) (feel free to pay me more)
